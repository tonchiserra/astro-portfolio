        My name is Gonzalo, but you can call me Tonchi. I'm a {age}-year-old Web Developer from Totoras, Santa Fe, Argentina, passionate about the IT world and continuous learning.

        In 2019, I started studying Systems Engineering at the National Technological University. However, in 2023 I realized that a traditional academic path wasn't the right fit for me, so I decided to focus on a self-taught journey, constantly improving my skills and building real-world projects.

        In 2022, I discovered Shopify and quickly became fascinated by its potential. I found real motivation in seeing how businesses could grow and increase their sales thanks to the solutions my team and I developed. Since then, I've been working as a Shopify Developer, always looking for new challenges and opportunities to keep improving.
